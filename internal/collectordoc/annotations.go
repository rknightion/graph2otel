package collectordoc

// annotations is the hand-written half of the collector reference: for each
// collector, the things the registry cannot know — what it is for, which Graph
// endpoints it polls, and any license gating that lives inside Collect()
// instead of in a declared interface.
//
// Everything else in a row (interval, lag, Experimental, the declared
// capability and scopes, a blob container and cursor key) is read off the live
// registry and must NOT be repeated here — a fact with two homes is a fact that
// drifts, which is the whole reason this file exists. What a collector emits
// is the same story, one level removed: it is read off its package's
// testdata/signals.json golden (#140, see signals.go), not hand-written here —
// this file used to carry an Emits field, and its prose drifted uncaught
// (annotations.go once claimed entra.organization emitted a metric name the
// collector never had).
//
// Adding a collector? TestCollectorAnnotationsCoverEveryCollector fails until
// there is an entry here, then TestCollectorReferenceDocInSync fails until
// docs/collectors.md is regenerated (`scripts/regen-generated.sh collectordoc`).
// A collector whose package has no testdata/signals.json golden fails Rows
// directly, by path, before either of those gates runs.
